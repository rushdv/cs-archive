# Network Theorems

## 1. Thevenin’s Theorem
Any linear bilateral network can be converted into a single voltage source (Vth) in series with a single resistor (Rth).

## 2. Norton’s Theorem
Any linear bilateral network can be converted into a single current source (In) in parallel with a single resistor (Rn).
*Note: Rn = Rth*

## 3. Superposition Theorem
In a linear circuit with multiple sources, the response in any element is the sum of responses caused by each source independently (others turned off/shorted/opened).

## 4. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
Maximum power is transferred to the load when Load Resistance (RL) = Source constant (Rth).
