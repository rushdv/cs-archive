# Properties of Matter

## Elasticity
Property to restore shape after deformation.
- **Stress:** Force / Area.
- **Strain:** Change in dimension / Original dimension.
- **Hooke’s Law:** Stress ∝ Strain (within elastic limit).
- **Young’s Modulus (Y):** Longitudinal Stress / Longitudinal Strain.

## Fluid Mechanics
- **Surface Tension:** Force acting per unit length on surface.
- **Viscosity:** Fluid friction.
- **Bernoulli’s Principle:** Conservation of energy in fluid flow.
