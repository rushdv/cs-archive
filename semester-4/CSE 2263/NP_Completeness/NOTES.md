# NP Completeness

## Classes of Problems
1.  **P (Polynomial Time):** Problems solvable in polynomial time (e.g., Sorting, Shortest Path).
2.  **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial):** Problems verifiable in polynomial time (e.g., Sudoku solution check).
3.  **NP-Complete:** Hardest problems in NP. If one is solved in P, all NP problems are solved in P (e.g., 3-SAT, Traveling Salesman).
4.  **NP-Hard:** Problems at least as hard as NP-Complete.

## Key Concept
**P = NP?**
One of the biggest unsolved problems in computer science. It asks if every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.
