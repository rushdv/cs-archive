# Greedy Algorithms

## Concept
Make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## Standard Problems
1.  **Activity Selection Problem:** Select max non-overlapping activities.
2.  **Fractional Knapsack:** Maximize value by taking fractions of items.
3.  **Huffman Coding:** Data compression using variable-length codes.
4.  **Prim’s & Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

## Characteristics
- **Greedy Choice Property:** Global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
- **Optimal Substructure:** Optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to sub-problems.
