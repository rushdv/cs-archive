# Introduction to Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

## Analysis of Algorithms
- **Time Complexity:** How time grows with input size (n).
- **Space Complexity:** How memory usage grows with input size.

## Asymptotic Notations
1.  **Big O (O):** Worst-case upper bound.
2.  **Omega (Ω):** Best-case lower bound.
3.  **Theta (Θ):** Average-case tight bound.

## Common Complexities
- O(1): Constant
- O(log n): Logarithmic (Binary Search)
- O(n): Linear
- O(n log n): Log-linear (Merge Sort)
- O(n^2): Quadratic (Bubble Sort)
