# Graph Algorithms

## Tree vs Graph
- **Tree:** Connected, acyclic graph.
- **Graph:** Collection of vertices (V) and edges (E).

## Traversal Algorithms
1.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
    *   Uses Queue.
    *   Level order traversal.
    *   Good for finding shortest path in unweighted graphs.
2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
    *   Uses Stack (or Recursion).
    *   Goes deep before collecting.

## Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Single-source shortest path (Greedy). Doesn't work with negative weights.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Single-source shortest path. Works with negative weights.
