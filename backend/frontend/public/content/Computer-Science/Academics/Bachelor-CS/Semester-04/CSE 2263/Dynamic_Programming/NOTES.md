# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Concept
Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems and storing results (Memoization/Tabulation) to avoid re-computation.

## DP vs Divide & Conquer
- **DP:** Sub-problems overlap.
- **D&C:** Sub-problems are independent.

## Classic Problems
1.  **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Maximize value without exceeding weight (Items cannot be broken).
2.  **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find longest subsequence common to two sequences.
3.  **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Optimizing the order of matrix multiplication.
4.  **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** All-pairs shortest path in a graph.
