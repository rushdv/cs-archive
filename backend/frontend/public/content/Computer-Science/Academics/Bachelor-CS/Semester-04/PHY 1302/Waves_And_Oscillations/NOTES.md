# Waves & Oscillations

## Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
- Motion where acceleration is proportional to displacement and directed towards mean position.
- **Formula:** a = -ω²x
- **Time Period:** T = 2π√(l/g) (Simple Pendulum)

## Wave Motion
- **Transverse Waves:** Particles vibrate perpendicular to wave direction (Light).
- **Longitudinal Waves:** Particles vibrate parallel to wave direction (Sound).

## Sound
- **Doppler Effect:** Change in frequency due to relative motion.
- **Beats:** Interference of two waves of slightly different frequencies.
