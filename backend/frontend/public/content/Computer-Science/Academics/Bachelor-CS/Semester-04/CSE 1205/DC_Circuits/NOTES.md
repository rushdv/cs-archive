# DC Circuits

## Basic Concepts
- **Voltage (V):** Potential difference (Volts).
- **Current (I):** Flow of charge (Amperes).
- **Resistance (R):** Opposition to current (Ohms).

## Fundamental Laws
1.  **Ohm's Law:** V = I * R
2.  **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** Sum of currents entering a node = Sum of currents leaving.
3.  **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** Sum of voltage drops around a loop = Sum of voltage sources.

## Analysis Methods
- **Modal Analysis:** Based on KCL.
- **Mesh Analysis:** Based on KVL.
