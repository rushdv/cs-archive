# Transient Analysis

## Concept
Behavior of a circuit immediately after switching (before reaching steady state).

## Elements
- **Inductor (L):** Opposes change in current. Initially Open Circuit.
- **Capacitor (C):** Opposes change in voltage. Initially Short Circuit.

## Time Constant (τ)
Time taken for the response to decay to 36.8% or rise to 63.2% of final value.
- **RC Circuit:** τ = R * C
- **RL Circuit:** τ = L / R
